What is Hormone-Free Chicken?
Hormone-free chicken means the birds are raised without the use of any added hormones or growth promoters to speed up their growth or increase size.

Important Facts:
No hormones are approved for use in poultry in many countries (including the US and EU), so "hormone-free" is often a reassurance to consumers.

Chickens grow naturally, relying on good nutrition, care, and environment rather than artificial hormone treatments.

Hormone-free labeling emphasizes natural, healthy growth and cleaner, safer meat.
